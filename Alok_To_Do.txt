Anitha is checking internally with her team first whether the data patch would be on permanent basis and if it is then she will be dropping a mail for the same. Ullico is aware about the change but there is no written communication from them yet.
If the data patch is confirmed, we will request Ullico to accommodate the change and if they disagree then we will make that change in our ETL routine.

Radheshyam Code changes.
